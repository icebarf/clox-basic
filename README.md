# Clox-basic

This is the C language implementation of jlox - the lox interpreter written in Java in Chapter 3 of the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

**This project is abandoned now**

Here are the functionalities built

- [x] Lexer or Scanner or Tokenizer
- [x] Abstract Syntax Tree
- [x] Parser
- [x] Evaluation
- [x] Statements
- [x] Control Flow
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Name resolving and binding
- [ ] Classes

## Dependencies

- GNU Readline
- Make
- [stb_ds.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_ds.h)

> stb_ds.h is shipped with the project.

## Abandonment
It needs severe redesign in how the interpreter handles objects created from compound expressions.
And also needs to rework the overall memory management strategy.

I learnt a great deal from crafting interpreters book. Awesome work over there.
Alas I could not translate all the java to c, but whatever.

Thus, it shall lie on a dark corner of the internet.
